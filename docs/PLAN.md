Three directions in which I wish to go:

- [ ]  Separating between searching for issues and then my React flow graph because otherwise the graph is overwhelming if I have all the issues in it. So I don't want to display all issues necessarily there or at once. I don't know.
- [ ]  Extracting issue dependency/link information.
- [ ] Moving off React flow or at least creating alternative visualization systems for the issues like a simple d3 node graph.

## Now 2025-12-30

- [ ] Record a walkthrough video of the app as is ...
- [ ] Decide if obsidian tasks analysis is a separate app or part of this


## for the github react flow stuff

- [ ] I want a way to have a list of the repos I've retrieved from and how to store that as a little project list that can be dropped down so I can switch between the projects I've already retrieved data for.
- [ ] I would also like a way to clear the stored issues for a given project for now and then for re-retrieve or retrieve again.
